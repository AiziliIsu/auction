## Online Auction System: A Project Overview

This document describes a **Spring Boot-based online auction system** that enables users to create and manage auctions, place bids, and track the entire auction lifecycle. The system is designed with a focus on providing **RESTful APIs** and uses a PostgreSQL database for data persistence.

-----

## Key Features & Functionality

The system includes a range of features to support a full auction experience:

  * **User Management:** Handles user registration, authentication, and the management of user profiles.
  * **Auction Lifecycle:** Allows users to create new auctions and manage their status, including `PENDING`, `ACTIVE`, `ENDED`, and `CANCELLED`.
  * **Bidding:** Enables users to place bids on active auctions and provides real-time validation to ensure bids are valid.
  * **Tracking:** Users can view the bidding history for a specific auction and see who the winner is once the auction ends.

-----

## Technology Stack

The project is built with modern and widely used technologies:

  * **Backend:**
      * **Java 17:** The core programming language.
      * **Spring Boot 3.4:** The framework for building the application.
      * **Spring Security:** Manages user authentication and authorization.
      * **Spring Data JPA:** Simplifies database interactions.
  * **Database:** **PostgreSQL** is used for storing all application data.
  * **Build & Testing:**
      * **Gradle:** The build automation tool.
      * **JUnit 5 & Mockito:** Used for comprehensive unit and integration testing.
  * **API Documentation:** **Swagger/OpenAPI** is integrated to provide clear and interactive API documentation.

## Database Schema

The system uses a simple and logical database structure with three primary tables to manage its data:

  * `users`: Stores user information and authentication credentials.
  * `auctions`: Contains details about auction items and their current status.
  * `bids`: Records all bids placed on auctions.

-----

## Setup & Configuration

To get the system up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

  * Java 17 or higher
  * PostgreSQL 12 or higher
  * Gradle 7.x

### Database Setup

1.  Create a new database for the project:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE auction_system;
    ```
2.  The tables will be automatically created by JPA when the application starts.

### Application Configuration

  * Update the `application.properties` file with your specific PostgreSQL database credentials.
  * The application runs on port `8080` by default.

### Build and Run

1.  Build the project using Gradle:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```
2.  Start the application:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew bootRun
    ```

-----

## API Endpoints

The system provides a clear set of RESTful endpoints for interacting with the application.

### User Management

  * `POST /api/users/register`: Registers a new user.
  * `GET /api/users/{id}`: Retrieves details for a specific user.

### Auction Management

  * `POST /api/auctions`: Creates a new auction.
  * `GET /api/auctions/{id}`: Retrieves details for a specific auction.
  * `GET /api/auctions/active`: Lists all active auctions.
  * `PUT /api/auctions/{id}`: Updates an existing auction.
  * `DELETE /api/auctions/{id}`: Deletes an auction.

### Bid Management

  * `POST /api/bids`: Places a new bid on an auction.
  * `GET /api/bids/auction/{auctionId}`: Gets all bids for a specific auction.
  * `GET /api/bids/user/{userId}`: Gets all bids placed by a specific user.
  * `GET /api/bids/auction/{auctionId}/highest`: Retrieves the highest bid for a specific auction.

-----

## Testing & Documentation

The project includes thorough test coverage and API documentation to ensure stability and ease of use.

  * **Testing:** The project includes `Controller`, `Service`, and `Integration` tests to ensure critical functionality works as expected.
  * **API Documentation:** The API documentation, generated by Swagger UI, can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`.

-----

## Future Enhancements

The project is built with future growth in mind. Potential additions include:

  * **Real-time Notifications:** Alerts users about new bids or auction status changes.
  * **Payment Integration:** Adds a secure way for auction winners to pay.
  * **User Ratings and Feedback:** Allows users to rate each other and provide feedback.
  * **Advanced Features:** Introduces search and filtering capabilities, as well as auction categories and tags.
